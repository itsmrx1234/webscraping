# Web Scraping Job Data with BeautifulSoup

## 📌 Overview
This project performs **web scraping** using `BeautifulSoup` to extract job listings from company websites and stores the data in a **Pandas DataFrame** for further analysis. The script automates data collection, making it useful for job market research and trend analysis.

## 📝 Description
This project is designed to scrape job-related data from company websites, including job titles, company names, locations, and salaries. The extracted data is then structured into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file for further analysis. The script can handle multiple pages, ensuring comprehensive data collection while following ethical web scraping practices.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts **job titles, company names, locations, salaries, and job descriptions**.
- Stores the data in a **structured Pandas DataFrame**.
- Supports **exporting data to CSV or Excel**.
- Handles **pagination** to scrape multiple pages.
- Uses **headers and time delays** to mimic human browsing and avoid blocking.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **BeautifulSoup** 🌿 (for parsing HTML)
- **Requests** (for fetching web pages)
- **Pandas** (for data storage and manipulation)

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webscraping-jobs.git
   cd webscraping-jobs
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🔍 Usage

1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python scrape_jobs.py
   ```
2. The script will fetch job data and store it in a DataFrame.
3. The data is automatically saved as a **CSV file**.
   ```bash
   jobs_data.csv
   ```

## 📝 Example Output
| Job Title       | Company       | Location       | Salary      | Link |
|----------------|--------------|---------------|------------|------|
| Software Engineer | Google        | California, USA | $120,000 | [Apply](#) |
| Data Analyst     | Microsoft     | New York, USA  | $90,000  | [Apply](#) |

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations
- Always **check the website's robots.txt file** before scraping.
- Do not overload the server with too many requests.
- Use `headers` and `time.sleep()` to behave like a real user.

## 📌 To-Do
- Add **support for dynamic websites** using Selenium.
- Implement **proxy rotation** to avoid IP bans.
- Store data in a **SQL database** instead of CSV.
